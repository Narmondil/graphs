# graphs
A few basic graph algorithms implemented in C using a custom graph library publicly available

The library for graph functions is available in french at the following url:
https://www.fil.univ-lille1.fr/~lemairef/ARO/doclibgraphe/index.html

Algorithms used for implementations derive from Dr. Lemaire's lectures on Algorithms and Operational Research

The trick to adapt Dijkstra for a maximum valued path was inspired from the work of William Fiset

Files graphe.c and graphe.h are offered here for convenience purposes, they are *not* part of my work and are available from the aforementionned library website.
